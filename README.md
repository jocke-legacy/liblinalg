liblinalg
=========

A simple library for linear algebra that I created to
learn more about it and to use together with OpenGL as
it "requires" it.

## Howto Use
Just type `make` and the link `liblinalg.a` with your programme.

You can also define `_DEBUG` in the makefile to compile with debugging
functions (see `linalg.h`)
